Thank you for taking the time to view my repository on my journey learning PHP.

Before cloning this repo, ensure that you have the proper stack downloaded to be able to clone this repository to the proper directory 'htdocs'. There are quite a few different stacks available for your PHP environment. For the purposes of this project the stack I am using is MAMP on MacOS, and the IDE I am using is VSCode. 

  • MAMP can be used on MacOS or Windows, it can be downloaded at this url: 
      https://www.mamp.info/en/downloads/

Other stacks are also available like XAMPP, which is a cross-platform stack that can be used on Linux, Windows, and MacOS. 

Setup
----------------------------------------------------------------
 
*FOR MacOS USERS ONLY*
  After you have downloaded the stack you choose to use, open your preferred IDE and in the terminal cd to MacintoshHD. Typically you will be cd'd to the root directory of your logged in user, to get to the correct directory type the following into the terminal 'cd /'. You will now be in MacintoshHD directory, from here type in the terminal 'cd applications/PREFERRED_STACK/htdocs' in my case I am using MAMP so I am typing in the terminal 'cd applications/mamp/htdocs'. From here VSCode makes it easy to clone github repositories to a project. 

    • Click 'fn + f1' and a dialogue box will appear at the top of VSCode
    • Type into the dialogue box 'gitcl' 
    • Select the option 'Git:clone'
    • Type into the new dialogue box the URL path to this repository:
        'https://github.com/CalebEWheeler/learn-php'

*FOR OTHER OS USERS*
  Whichever stack you decide to use, ensure that in your IDE's terminal you cd to the location of your stack and you are cd'd into the directory 'htdocs'.  
  -*All PHP files should live in 'htdocs' for proper deployment purposes*-
  Whichever IDE you decide to use, learn that IDE's method for cloning Github repositories. Each IDE is a little different, the majority of my experience is coming from IntelliJ. Each is easy, but VSCode's method is much easier to utilize. 

Happy coding!
